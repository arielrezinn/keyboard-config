# Keyboard Config

I've made a number of changes to the firmware of my [Keychron K6 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k6-pro-user-guide), but don't want to be locked down to one specific fork of [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). 

This board has bluetooth capability, which is only included in the [bluetooth_playground](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware/tree/bluetooth_playground) branch of Keychron's fork of [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/Keychron/qmk_firmware). 

I prefer Vial to Via because, unlike Via, Vial is open-source and stores a copy of the keymap on the keyboard.
